1) BUILD APPLICATIONS FOR NON-ANDROID

	The apps are auto rebuilt along with driver using the original Makefile.
	The Android.mk files under app directories are not needed and can be removed.

	The following option in Makefile can be modified to use static library link.
		export CONFIG_STATIC_LINK=n

2) BUILD APPLICATIONS FOR ANDROID

	1. Need to have Android project setup

	2. Copy application code including Android.mk to directory inside Android project
		e.g.
		cp -rf wlan_src/mapp $PROJ/vendor/marvell/mdriver_release

	3. For new terminal, need to first run
		cd <android_project_dir>
		. build/envsetup.sh
		chooseproduct dkbtd    ## for PXA920 OR evbpv2 for PXA950 etc.
		export ANDROID_PREBUILT_MODULES=kernel/out/modules

	4. Rebuild the app
		e.g.
		make clean-mlan2040coex clean-mlanconfig clean-mlanutl clean-mlanevent.exe clean-uaputl.exe
		make mlan2040coex mlanconfig mlanutl mlanevent.exe uaputl.exe

	5. Rebuilt apps will be at out/target/product/<chooseproduct_value>/system/bin

	6. The apps rebuilt along with driver through Makefile may not work for Android
